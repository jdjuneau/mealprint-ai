# GO TO THIS URL INSTEAD

You're on the WRONG form. The "Create service" form is for containers, not functions.

## Direct Link to Function Form

**Click this link:**
https://console.cloud.google.com/functions/create?project=vanish-auth-real

This will take you directly to the **"Write a function"** form which has:
- ✅ Entry point field
- ✅ Timeout field  
- ✅ Memory field
- ✅ Source code section (inline editor or ZIP upload)

## OR Use the Button

1. Click **"Cancel"** on your current form
2. Look at the **TOP TOOLBAR** (above everything)
3. Click **"Write a function"** button (has `{...}` icon)

## The Form You're On Now

The "Create service" form you're on is for:
- Container images
- Docker deployments
- NOT for Cloud Functions

That's why you see:
- ❌ Container image URL
- ❌ Container port
- ❌ Container command
- ❌ NO Entry point field
- ❌ NO Source code upload

## The Form You Need

The "Write a function" form has:
- ✅ Function name
- ✅ Entry point
- ✅ Timeout
- ✅ Memory
- ✅ Source code (inline editor or ZIP)

**Just go to the URL above or click "Write a function" button.**
