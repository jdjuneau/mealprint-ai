Rules:
- 🎲🎲🎲 CRITICAL VARIETY REQUIREMENT - THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE 🎲🎲🎲
  * ⚠️ ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT: This week's meal plan MUST be COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from any previous week
  * ⚠️ NO REPEATS: Do not use the same meal names, recipes, or meal combinations you've used before
  * ⚠️ UNIQUE EVERY WEEK: Each week should feel like a brand new, exciting meal plan
  * ROTATE CUISINES: Each day must feature a different cuisine - no two consecutive days should have the same cuisine type
  * VARY COOKING METHODS: Use at least 5-6 different cooking methods throughout the week
  * ROTATE PROTEINS: Maximum 2-3 uses of the same protein per week - use at least 4-5 different proteins
  * VARY VEGETABLES: Use 10-15 different vegetables - don't repeat the same vegetable more than 3-4 times
  * DIFFERENT MEAL TYPES: Mix at least 5-6 different meal types (bowls, wraps, salads, soups, casseroles, etc.)
  * UNIQUE RECIPES: Every meal must have a SPECIFIC, DESCRIPTIVE name - no generic names allowed
  * SNACK VARIETY: Use at least 4-5 different snack types throughout the week
  * CREATIVITY: Be creative and adventurous - surprise the user with new flavor combinations and meal ideas
- CRITICAL: MAXIMIZE INGREDIENT REUSE to minimize shopping list
- ⚠️⚠️⚠️ ABSOLUTE HARD LIMIT: 25 UNIQUE ITEMS MAXIMUM ⚠️⚠️⚠️
- If you generate 26, 30, 40, or 50+ items, you have FAILED - the response will be rejected
- COUNT YOUR ITEMS BEFORE FINALIZING - if you have more than 25, you MUST:
  * Combine similar items (e.g., "Bell peppers" + "Red peppers" → "Bell peppers")
  * Remove less essential items (spices, condiments that are likely already in pantry)
  * Group related items (e.g., "Garlic" + "Garlic powder" → just "Garlic")
  * Consolidate categories (e.g., "Olive oil" appears in multiple categories → list once)
- Design meals that share core ingredients across 3-4 days (not just 2):
  * Use the SAME protein source 3-4 times (e.g., chicken breast Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday)
  * Use the SAME vegetables across 4-5 meals (e.g., bell peppers in 5 different meals)
  * Use the SAME grains/starches 3-4 times (e.g., rice for 4 meals, quinoa for 3 meals)
  * Use the SAME pantry staples (olive oil, spices, salt, pepper) - only list once with total quantity
- Before finalizing, COUNT your shopping list items across ALL categories. If > 25, remove less essential items or combine similar ones
- FINAL CHECK: Count every single item in your shopping list. If the count is 26 or more, you MUST reduce it to 25 or fewer
- Every meal: catchy name, per-serving macros, ingredients with exact quantities, 3–6 simple steps
- MUST meet daily macro targets: 180g protein / 200g carbs / 100g fat per day
- MUST follow dietary preference: Keto
- [Keto dietary rules - another 10-15 lines]
- Combine ALL duplicates → one consolidated shopping list with TOTAL quantities needed for the entire week
