# This file specifies files that are *not* uploaded to Google Cloud
# using gcloud. It follows the same syntax as .gitignore, with the addition of
# "#!include" directives (which insert the entries of the given .gitignore-style
# file at that point).
#
# For more information, run:
#   $ gcloud topic gcloudignore
#
.gcloudignore
.git
.gitignore
node_modules
.env
*.log
# IMPORTANT: lib/ MUST be included for deployment - do NOT ignore it
# (lib/ is in .gitignore but we need it for gcloud deploy)
