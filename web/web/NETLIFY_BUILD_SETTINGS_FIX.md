# How to Find Build Settings in Netlify

## Step-by-Step:

1. **On the Deploys page**, look for the **"Deploy settings"** button (gear icon) at the top
2. **Click "Deploy settings"** - this will take you to the settings page
3. **Scroll down** to find **"Build settings"** section
4. **Click "Edit settings"** in the Build settings section
5. **Set these values:**
   - **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory:** `.next`
6. **Click "Save"**
7. **Go back to Deploys** and click **"Trigger deploy"** → **"Deploy site"**

## Direct Link:

Or go directly to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/coachieai/settings/deploys

The build settings are on that page, not on the main Deploys page.
